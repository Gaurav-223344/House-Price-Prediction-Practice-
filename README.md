## Overview
This is a practice project to enhance my skills like feature-engineering and feature-selection. In this project, I solve problems like missing values in continous and catagorical data, curse of dimension, feature-encoding etc. Then I try different regression models and use hyperparameter tuning.

## Motivation
This is just a practice project to build a machine learning model to accurately predict price of house by using various features. For this I used dataset which provide by greate learning academy team.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into two part:
1. Feature Engineering
2. Training a machine learning model using sklearn.
